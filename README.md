## Motivation
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegerative disease. Though best known for its role in declining memory function, symptoms also include: difficulty thinking and reasoning, making judgements and decisions, planning and performing familiar tasks. It may also cause alterations in personality and behavior (source [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alzheimers-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20350447 "Mayo Clinic - Alzheimer's Disease"))
