# Alzheimer's Diagnosis
Research Project by Grant Gasser under advisement of [Dr. Joshua Patrick](https://www.baylor.edu/statistics/index.php?id=941853 "Joshua Patrick")

## Summary of Alzheimer's Disease
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegerative disease. Though best known for its role in declining memory function, symptoms also include: difficulty thinking and reasoning, making judgements and decisions, and planning and performing familiar tasks. It may also cause alterations in personality and behavior. The cause of AD is not well understood. There is thought to be a significant hereditary component. For example, a variation of the APOE gene, APOE e4, increases risk of Alzheimer's disease. Pathologically, AD is associated with [amyloid beta plaques](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&authuser=0&biw=1500&bih=687&tbm=isch&sa=1&ei=kf95XM7aDqq4jwS8gLq4Dw&q=amyloid+plaques&oq=amyloid+plaques&gs_l=img.3..35i39j0l7.4609.6096..6209...0.0..0.53.317.7......1....1..gws-wiz-img.GSgXEP-kU3g) and [neurofibrillary tangles](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&authuser=0&tbm=isch&q=amyloid+plaques&chips=q:amyloid+plaques,g_1:neurofibrillary+tangles:g4CvXoEy7h0%3D&usg=AI4_-kTMw9QaPmdY4wGL4xAlH9TlVhV6-w&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjtrcviyOLgAhWI5YMKHSUWCAIQ4lYIKigB&biw=1500&bih=687&dpr=1).

### Diagnosis
Onset of the disease is slow and early symptoms are often dismissed as normal signs of ageing. A diagnosis is typically given based on history of illness, cognitive tests, medical imaging, and blood tests.

### Treatment
There is no medication that stops or reverses the progression of AD. There are two types of drugs that attempt to treat the cognitive symptoms:
* Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitors that work to prevent the breakdown of acetylcholine, a neuorotransmitter critical in memory and cognition. 
* Memantine (Namenda), which works to inhibit NMDA receptors in the brain.
These medications can slightly slow down the progression of the disease.

### Prevention
It is thought that frequent mental and physical exercise may reduce risk.

## Project Motivation
The Alheimer's Association estimates nearly 6 million Americans suffer from the disease and is the 6th leading cause of death in the US. The estimated cost of AD was $277 billion just in the US. They estimate *early and accurate* diagnoses could save up to $7.9 trillion in medical and care costs over the next 30 years.

### Project Description
Using data provided by the [ADNI Project](http://adni.loni.usc.edu/), it is our goal to develop a computer model that assists in the diagnosis of the disease. We will try multiple models recently popularized in machine learning (neural networks, SVM's, Random Forests) and more traditional statistical models such as multinomial regression, ordinal regression, and decision trees.
